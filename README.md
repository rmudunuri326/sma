### 📈 Predicted Trend Indicators
Color-coded trend arrows based on multi-factor technical analysis:
- **<span style="color:green">↑</span>** Strong uptrend (green) - Multiple bullish indicators aligned (score ≥4.0)
- **<span style="color:green">↗</span>** Moderate uptrend (green) - Bullish bias detected (score ≥1.5)
- **<span style="color:gray">→</span>** Neutral/sideways (gray) - Mixed or weak signals (-1.5 to 1.5)
- **<span style="color:red">↘</span>** Moderate downtrend (red) - Bearish bias detected (score ≤-1.5)
- **<span style="color:red">↓</span>** Strong downtrend (red) - Multiple bearish indicators aligned (score ≤-4.0)

**Trend Scoring Logic:**
- **MACD** (±2.0): Bullish/Bearish signal (excluded if MACD is active strategy)
- **RSI** (±0.5 to ±1.0): Current momentum direction (>50 = bullish, <50 = bearish)
- **BB Position** (±0.5 to ±1.0): Current trend (>60% = bullish, <40% = bearish)
- **Ichimoku Cloud** (±2.0 to ±2.5): Price above/below cloud with TK cross confirmation
- **Active Signal** (±1.0 to ±2.5): Dynamic weight based on strategy reliability
- **Price Momentum** (±1.0): Daily change threshold (default ±2.0%)

Strategy weights: Ichimoku (2.5), Combined (2.0), BB+Ichimoku (1.8), MACD (1.5), BB (1.2), RSI (1.0)

### 🎯 Trading Signal Framework
Inter-strategy agreement analysis for actionable signals:
- **STRONG (≥75%)**: High agreement across strategies (3+ strategies agreeing)
- **MODERATE (50-75%)**: Partial consensus (2 strategies agreeing)
- **WEAK (<50%)**: Low agreement or conflicting signals
- **Note**: HOLD signals don't receive confidence scores (neutral positions)

Helps filter low-quality signals and focus on high-probability setups. Only BUY, SHORT, and SELL signals are scored.

Set strategy via environment variable:
```bash
export TRADING_STRATEGY=bb_ichimoku  # bb, rsi, macd, ichimoku, combined, bb_ichimoku
```

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Prepare your ticker list** - Create or edit `data/tickers.csv`:
   ```
   AAPL
   MSFT
   GOOGL
   NVDA
   TSLA
   ```

2. **Optional: Configure custom alerts** - Create `data/alerts.json` (see Custom Alerts section below)

3. **Run the dashboard generator**:
   ```bash
   python3 stocks.py data/tickers.csv
   ```

4. **Wait for completion** - The script will:
   - Fetch data for all tickers in parallel
   - Auto-detect current market hours (regular vs extended)
   - Calculate technical indicators and trading signals
   - Generate dashboard with appropriate data for the session
   - Display execution time in minutes

5. **View the dashboard** - Open the generated HTML file:
   - `data/dashboard.html` - Automatically shows regular or extended hours data based on when it was run
   
   Or open directly in browser:
   ```bash
   open data/dashboard.html
   ```

### Output

The script generates:
- `data/dashboard.html` - Single dashboard file with auto-detected market hours data
- Console output with execution time:
  ```
  ✓ Dashboard generated: data/dashboard.html (took 2.34 minutes)
  
  ⏱️  Total time: 2.34 minutes
  ```

**Market Hours Detection:**
- The dashboard automatically determines if it's regular hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET, Mon-Fri)
- During regular hours: Fetches regular market data (no badge shown)
- Outside regular hours: Fetches extended hours data (shows "Extended Hours" badge)
- GitHub Actions workflow runs every 30 minutes from 4 AM - 5 PM PST on weekdays

export RSI_EXTREME_OVERBOUGHT=80    # Extreme overbought (default: 80)
```

### MACD Configuration
```bash
export MACD_PERIOD=150              # Historical data period in days (default: 150, range: 50-150)
```

### Ichimoku Configuration
```bash
export ICHIMOKU_VOL_FILTER=0        # Min volume filter (default: 0 = disabled)
export ICHIMOKU_PRICE_FILTER=0      # Min price filter (default: 0 = disabled)
```

### Combined Strategy Weights
```bash
export WEIGHT_ICHIMOKU=1.5          # Ichimoku weight (default: 1.5)
export WEIGHT_MACD=1.2              # MACD weight (default: 1.2)
export WEIGHT_BB=1.0                # Bollinger Bands weight (default: 1.0)
export WEIGHT_RSI=0.8               # RSI weight (default: 0.8)
export COMBINED_THRESHOLD=2.0       # Threshold for signals (default: 2.0)
```

### BB+Ichimoku Mode
```bash
export BB_ICHIMOKU_MODE=CONFIRM     # OR | AND | CONFIRM (default: CONFIRM)
# OR: Either BB or Ichimoku (aggressive)
# AND: Both must agree (conservative)
# CONFIRM: BB primary with Ichimoku confirmation (balanced)
```

### Trend Prediction
```bash
export TREND_MOMENTUM_THRESHOLD=2.5  # Threshold for trend signal (default: 2.5)
```

### Risk Management & Trade Setup
```bash
export ATR_STOP_MULTIPLIER=2.0      # ATR multiplier for stop loss (default: 2.0)
export RISK_PER_TRADE=2.0           # % of account to risk per trade (default: 2.0)
```

**Trade Setup Calculation:**
- Stop Loss = Entry Price ± (ATR × ATR_STOP_MULTIPLIER)
- Target = Entry Price ± (ATR × ATR_STOP_MULTIPLIER × 2)  # 2:1 R:R
- Risk % = (|Entry - Stop Loss| / Entry) × 100
- Reward % = (|Target - Entry| / Entry) × 100

**Example with ATR_STOP_MULTIPLIER=2.0:**
- Stock at $100, ATR = $2.50
- BUY Setup:
  - Entry: $100.00
  - Stop Loss: $95.00 (100 - 2.5×2)
  - Target: $110.00 (100 + 2.5×4)
  - Risk/Reward: 5% / 10% (1:2)

### Custom Alerts
Create `data/alerts.json` to define custom alert conditions for specific tickers. The system supports multiple alert types:

**Available Alert Conditions:**

1. **Price Thresholds:**
   - `price_above` - Alert when price exceeds a specific value
   - `price_below` - Alert when price falls below a specific value

2. **Daily Price Changes:**
   - `day_change_above` - Alert when daily % change exceeds a threshold
   - `day_change_below` - Alert when daily % change falls below a threshold

3. **RSI Levels:**
   - `rsi_oversold` - Alert when RSI drops below 30 (oversold)
   - `rsi_overbought` - Alert when RSI rises above 70 (overbought)

4. **Volume Activity:**
   - `volume_spike` - Alert when volume exceeds 150% of average

5. **Trading Signals:**
   - `buy` - Alert on BUY signals from active strategy
   - `sell` - Alert on SELL signals from active strategy
   - `short` - Alert on SHORT signals from active strategy

**Example `data/alerts.json`:**
```json
[
  {
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "condition": "price_above",
    "value": 200
  },
  {
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "condition": "price_below",
    "value": 150
  },
  {
    "ticker": "NVDA",
    "condition": "day_change_above",
    "value": 5
  },
  {
    "ticker": "AMD",
    "condition": "day_change_below",
    "value": -3
  },
  {
    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "condition": "rsi_oversold"
  },
  {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "condition": "rsi_overbought"
  },
  {
    "ticker": "META",
    "condition": "volume_spike"
  },
  {
    "ticker": "AMZN",
    "condition": "buy"
  },
  {
    "ticker": "SPY",
    "condition": "sell"
  },
  {
    "ticker": "QQQ",
    "condition": "short"
  }
]
```

**Notes:**
- Price and percentage conditions require a `value` field
- RSI, volume, and signal conditions do not require a `value`
- Alerts appear in the banner at the top of the dashboard
- Custom alerts are cached for 30 minutes to improve performance
