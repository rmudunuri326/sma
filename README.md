## Features
## Machine Learning Integration

### 🚀 ML-Powered Stock Predictions (NEW!)
**Identify the Next NVDA, MU Before They Breakout**: Machine learning model trained on historical winners/losers to predict:
- **Breakout Score (0-100%)**: Stocks with >100% gain potential (like NVDA, MU patterns)
- **Crash Risk (0-100%)**: Stocks at risk of >50% decline
- **Integrated in INDICATORS Column**: ML breakout/crash scores are now fully merged into the INDICATORS column (no separate column).
- Color-coded: 🟢 Green (≥70%), 🟠 Orange (50-69%), Gray (<50%)
- ⚠️ Crash warnings for high-risk stocks
- See [ML_GUIDE.md](ML_GUIDE.md) for complete guide

**Troubleshooting ML N/A Values:**
- If ML values show as N/A, check:
  - The ML model files exist in `data/ml_models/` (see ML_GUIDE.md for retraining)
  - The ticker is supported by the model (U.S. equities only)
  - All required features are available for the ticker
  - The ticker is not an ETF or non-stock symbol
  - See the console output for any error messages

### 🎯 Trading Strategies
Six sophisticated trading strategies with visual indicators (🟢 BUY, 🟠 SELL, 🔴 SHORT, ⏸️ HOLD):

- **Bollinger Bands (BB)**: Price channel breakout detection
  - BUY: Price ≤10% of BB range (oversold)
  - SHORT: Price ≥90% of BB range (overbought)
  - SELL: Price ≥85% AND reversing down (exit longs)
  - HOLD: 10-85% range (normal)
  - Configurable thresholds via `BB_BUY_THRESHOLD`, `BB_SHORT_THRESHOLD`, `BB_SELL_THRESHOLD`

- **RSI**: Oversold/overbought momentum analysis
  - BUY: RSI ≤30 (oversold)
  - SHORT: RSI ≥70 (overbought)
  - SELL: Dropping from overbought OR failing to bounce from oversold
  - HOLD: 30-70 range (normal)
  - Configurable via `RSI_OVERSOLD`, `RSI_OVERBOUGHT`, `RSI_SELL_THRESHOLD`

- **MACD**: Trend following with crossover signals
  - BUY: Bullish crossover (MACD > Signal)
  - SHORT: Bearish crossover (MACD < Signal)
  - SELL: Crossing from bullish to bearish
  - HOLD: No recent crossover
  - Configurable lookback period: `MACD_PERIOD` (50-150 days, default: 150)

- **Ichimoku Cloud**: Multi-component trend and support/resistance
  - BUY: Price crosses above base line in bullish cloud
  - SHORT: Price crosses below base line in bearish cloud
  - SELL: Price crosses below in bearish cloud
  - HOLD: Price above/below base line maintaining bullish/bearish position
  - Optional filters: `ICHIMOKU_VOL_FILTER`, `ICHIMOKU_PRICE_FILTER` (set to 0 to disable)

- **Combined Strategy**: Weighted voting with conflict resolution
  - Aggregates signals from BB, RSI, MACD, Ichimoku with configurable weights
  - Default weights: Ichimoku (1.5), MACD (1.2), BB (1.0), RSI (0.8)
  - BUY/SHORT: Requires weighted score ≥2.0 with no conflicting signals
  - SELL: Only if not conflicting with entry signals
  - HOLD: Only if no strong entry signals exist
  - Configurable via `WEIGHT_*` and `COMBINED_THRESHOLD` variables

- **BB + Ichimoku (Default)**: Multi-mode confirmation strategy
  - **CONFIRM mode** (default): Balanced approach
    - BUY/SHORT: Both BB and Ichimoku must agree
    - SELL: Either can trigger (risk management priority)
    - HOLD: Both must agree
  - **AND mode**: Most conservative - all signals require both strategies
  - **OR mode**: Most aggressive - either strategy can trigger any signal
  - Set via `BB_ICHIMOKU_MODE=CONFIRM|AND|OR`

**Signal Types:**
- 🟢 **BUY** - Strong bullish signal, entry opportunity
- 🔴 **SHORT** - Strong bearish signal, short entry opportunity
- 🟠 **SELL** - Exit signal for existing positions
- ⏸️ **HOLD** - Neutral position, no action recommended

### 📈 Predicted Trend Indicators
Color-coded trend arrows based on multi-factor technical analysis:
- **<span style="color:green">↑</span>** Strong uptrend (green) - Multiple bullish indicators aligned (score ≥4.0)
- **<span style="color:green">↗</span>** Moderate uptrend (green) - Bullish bias detected (score ≥1.5)
- **<span style="color:gray">→</span>** Neutral/sideways (gray) - Mixed or weak signals (-1.5 to 1.5)
- **<span style="color:red">↘</span>** Moderate downtrend (red) - Bearish bias detected (score ≤-1.5)
- **<span style="color:red">↓</span>** Strong downtrend (red) - Multiple bearish indicators aligned (score ≤-4.0)

**Trend Scoring Logic:**
- **MACD** (±2.0): Bullish/Bearish signal (excluded if MACD is active strategy)
- **RSI** (±0.5 to ±1.0): Current momentum direction (>50 = bullish, <50 = bearish)
- **BB Position** (±0.5 to ±1.0): Current trend (>60% = bullish, <40% = bearish)
- **Ichimoku Cloud** (±2.0 to ±2.5): Price above/below cloud with TK cross confirmation
- **Active Signal** (±1.0 to ±2.5): Dynamic weight based on strategy reliability
- **Price Momentum** (±1.0): Daily change threshold (default ±2.0%)

Strategy weights: Ichimoku (2.5), Combined (2.0), BB+Ichimoku (1.8), MACD (1.5), BB (1.2), RSI (1.0)

### 🎯 Trading Signal Framework
Inter-strategy agreement analysis for actionable signals:
- **STRONG (≥75%)**: High agreement across strategies (3+ strategies agreeing)
- **MODERATE (50-75%)**: Partial consensus (2 strategies agreeing)
- **WEAK (<50%)**: Low agreement or conflicting signals
- **Note**: HOLD signals don't receive confidence scores (neutral positions)

Helps filter low-quality signals and focus on high-probability setups. Only BUY, SHORT, and SELL signals are scored.

Set strategy via environment variable:
```bash
export TRADING_STRATEGY=bb_ichimoku  # bb, rsi, macd, ichimoku, combined, bb_ichimoku
```

- Outside regular hours: Fetches extended hours data (shows "Extended Hours" badge)
- GitHub Actions workflow runs every 30 minutes from 4 AM - 5 PM PST on weekdays

### Ticker File Format
`data/tickers.csv` - One ticker per line (newline or comma-separated):
```
AAPL
MSFT
GOOGL
```

## Configuration

Customize trading strategies and risk management via environment variables:

### Trading Strategy Selection
```bash
export TRADING_STRATEGY=bb_ichimoku  # bb, rsi, macd, ichimoku, combined, bb_ichimoku
```

### Bollinger Bands Configuration
```bash
export BB_BUY_THRESHOLD=10          # Buy below this BB% (default: 10)
export BB_SHORT_THRESHOLD=90        # Short above this BB% (default: 90)
export BB_SELL_THRESHOLD=85         # Sell threshold for reversal detection (default: 85)
```

### RSI Configuration
```bash
export RSI_OVERSOLD=30              # Oversold threshold (default: 30)
export RSI_OVERBOUGHT=70            # Overbought threshold (default: 70)
export RSI_EXTREME_OVERSOLD=20      # Extreme oversold (default: 20)
export RSI_EXTREME_OVERBOUGHT=80    # Extreme overbought (default: 80)
```

### MACD Configuration
```bash
export MACD_PERIOD=150              # Historical data period in days (default: 150, range: 50-150)
```

### Ichimoku Configuration
```bash
export ICHIMOKU_VOL_FILTER=0        # Min volume filter (default: 0 = disabled)
export ICHIMOKU_PRICE_FILTER=0      # Min price filter (default: 0 = disabled)
```

### Combined Strategy Weights
```bash
export WEIGHT_ICHIMOKU=1.5          # Ichimoku weight (default: 1.5)
export WEIGHT_MACD=1.2              # MACD weight (default: 1.2)
export WEIGHT_BB=1.0                # Bollinger Bands weight (default: 1.0)
export WEIGHT_RSI=0.8               # RSI weight (default: 0.8)
export COMBINED_THRESHOLD=2.0       # Threshold for signals (default: 2.0)
```

### BB+Ichimoku Mode
```bash
export BB_ICHIMOKU_MODE=CONFIRM     # OR | AND | CONFIRM (default: CONFIRM)
# OR: Either BB or Ichimoku (aggressive)
# AND: Both must agree (conservative)
# CONFIRM: BB primary with Ichimoku confirmation (balanced)
```

### Trend Prediction
```bash
export TREND_MOMENTUM_THRESHOLD=2.5  # Threshold for trend signal (default: 2.5)
```

### Risk Management & Trade Setup
```bash
export ATR_STOP_MULTIPLIER=2.0      # ATR multiplier for stop loss (default: 2.0)
export RISK_PER_TRADE=2.0           # % of account to risk per trade (default: 2.0)
```

**Trade Setup Calculation:**
- Stop Loss = Entry Price ± (ATR × ATR_STOP_MULTIPLIER)
- Target = Entry Price ± (ATR × ATR_STOP_MULTIPLIER × 2)  # 2:1 R:R
- Risk % = (|Entry - Stop Loss| / Entry) × 100
- Reward % = (|Target - Entry| / Entry) × 100

**Example with ATR_STOP_MULTIPLIER=2.0:**
- Stock at $100, ATR = $2.50
- BUY Setup:
  - Entry: $100.00
  - Stop Loss: $95.00 (100 - 2.5×2)
  - Target: $110.00 (100 + 2.5×4)
  - Risk/Reward: 5% / 10% (1:2)
