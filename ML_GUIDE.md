## Data Processing Details

### Historical Data Timeline

The ML model processes **2 years (504 trading days)** of historical data per ticker with a specific training methodology:

```
[2 years ago] ← [1 year ago: Features] → [6-12 months: Future performance]
     ↓              ↓                        ↓
   Fetched        Used for                  Used for
   data          prediction               labeling
```

**Step-by-step process:**
1. **Fetch 2 years of data**: `yf.Ticker(ticker).history(period="2y")`
2. **Feature generation**: Use data from exactly 252 trading days ago (1 year back)
3. **Technical analysis**: Calculate RSI, BB, MACD, volume patterns, etc. at that historical point
4. **Future evaluation**: Check price performance over next 6-12 months
5. **Label assignment**: 
   - **BREAKOUT**: +100% or more gain in 6-12 months
   - **CRASH**: -50% or more loss in 6-12 months  
   - **NEUTRAL**: Performance between -50% and +100%

**Why this approach?**
- **252 trading days** = ~1 year (market cycles)
- **504 trading days** = ~2 years (sufficient historical context)
- **6-12 month horizon** = Medium-term breakout/crash detection
- Simulates real-world prediction: "What would we have predicted 1 year ago?"

### Minimum Data Requirements

- **252+ trading days** minimum (1 year of data)
- Stocks with insufficient history are skipped
- Ensures reliable technical indicator calculations

## Quick Start

### 1. Training the Model

The model needs historical data to learn patterns. The training script automatically detects and uses your data:

**Primary Method: Train on Your Tickers (Recommended)**
```bash
# Train ML model using tickers from data/tickers.csv
python3 ml_predictor.py
```

This will:
- Load tickers from `data/tickers.csv` (if it exists)
- **Smart data loading**: Use cached data when available, only fetch new data since last update
- Fetch real historical data for each ticker (2 years of data on first run)
- Train the model on actual market patterns
- Save model files to `data/ml_models/` and cache data to `data/stock_cache/`
- **Quiet logging**: Shows progress every 50 tickers by default (use `--verbose` for detailed output)

**Caching Benefits:**
- **First run**: Downloads and caches 2 years of data (~10-15 minutes)
- **Subsequent runs**: Uses cached data + fetches only new data (~1-2 minutes)
- **Data persistence**: Cache survives between runs for faster training

**Fallback: Synthetic Demo Data (if no tickers.csv)**
```bash
# If data/tickers.csv doesn't exist, generates synthetic training data
python3 ml_predictor.py
```

### Manual Training (Advanced Users)

For custom training with specific tickers, create a training script (`train_ml_model.py`):

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
from ml_predictor import train_model, load_or_fetch_stock_data
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Load tickers from data/tickers.csv (or specify manually)
tickers = ['NVDA', 'MU', 'AMD', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'AAPL', 'MSFT', ...] # Add your tickers
historical_data = []
labels = []

for ticker in tickers:
    # Smart data loading: Use cache when available, only fetch new data
    hist = load_or_fetch_stock_data(ticker)
    
    # Use data from 1 year ago (252 trading days back) for features
    # Check performance over next 6-12 months for labeling
    # Label as BREAKOUT (+100%+), CRASH (-50%-), or NEUTRAL
    
    # ... extract features and determine label ...
    historical_data.append(features_dict)
    labels.append(label)

# Train model
model, scaler = train_model(historical_data, labels)
```

### 2. Running with ML Predictions

Once trained, ML scores appear automatically:

```bash
# Run dashboard (ML predictions included automatically if model exists)
python3 stocks.py data/tickers.csv
```

The dashboard will show:
- **INDICATORS Column**: ML scores integrated with other indicators
  - **🚀 BREAKOUT (≥70%)**: High breakout potential with green highlighting
  - **💥 CRASH (≥50%)**: High crash risk with red highlighting  
  - **NEUTRAL**: Low probability signals
- ⚠️ **ML Alerts**: Breakout and crash alerts in the dashboard banner

## Understanding ML Scores

### Breakout Score Interpretation

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **80-100%** | Strong breakout signal (similar to past winners like NVDA) | Consider for watchlist |
| **60-79%** | Moderate potential | Monitor closely |
| **40-59%** | Mixed signals | Wait for confirmation |
| **<40%** | Low probability | Not a priority |

### Crash Risk Interpretation

| Risk | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| **≥70%** | High crash risk | Avoid or exit positions |
| **50-69%** | Elevated risk | Use tight stops |
| **30-49%** | Normal risk | Monitor |
| **<30%** | Low risk | - |
